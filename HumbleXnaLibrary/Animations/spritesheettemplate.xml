  <!--
  
    A complete spritesheet is composed of :
    
    a <texturename> field, which references the name of the texture used for this animation
    a list of animation states <states>. Each state corresponds to a line of the sprite sheet, and must be
    added in the correct order
  
    Every sprite sheet must have at least the following state : normal
    Normal is the basic animation, running most of the time
  
    Each state has the following fields : (they must be written in that order for the xml import to work)
      
      (MANDATORY)
      
      name (string) used to reference the state in question
      switchdelay (int) defines in milliseconds the timeout between each frame change
      width (px) defines the width of the frames
      height (px) defines the width of the frames
      nextstate (string) defines the name of the state following the current
      framecount (int) defines the number of frames the state is composed of
  
  
      The following fiels are used as an example.
